# IPOP Structured P2P GroupVPN Controller

### Description
This project implements an IPOP GroupVPN controller for end-systems to operate in a structured peer-to-peer virtual private network. The controller is based on the refactored controller framework [1] for the IPOP project [2].

A set of scripts is available for automated preparation and simulation of a testbed for scalable testing of the IPOP network.
